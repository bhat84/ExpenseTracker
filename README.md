# ExpenseTracker
The basic idea of this project is to design and develop expense tracking app. As the name indicates, this system provides ability to manage personal income and expenses. The application will use Amazon login service to verify the userâ€™s credentials. The user can input income and expense details and get the predicted expenses for the month. 
In this proposed application, we intend to leverage current trending web development technologies such as AngularJS, HTML5, and CSS, integrating with Amazon cloud services.
